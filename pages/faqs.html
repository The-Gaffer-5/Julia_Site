                Before schedule an appointment, it is recommended that you schedule an introductory 10-
                mintue phone call. There is no cost for this conversation and it will help determine if you are an
                appropriate fit for the practice. <a href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=17894991&amp;appointmentType=10525733">Click Here</a><br><br>

                No. Private insurance is considered out-of-network. Payment is required at the time of service.
                You will be provided a super bill, which is documentation that you can submit to your insurer
                for out-of-network reimbursement. Patients are responsible for verifying their out-of-network
                benefits with their insurance company and for filing claims.

                Your first visit will consist of an initial evaluation. During the evaluation, you will be asked
                questions about your current symptoms, your past psychiatric history, your medical history and
                other relevant information. These questions may be personal and uncomfortable to talk about
                or cause discomfort in some people. You are encouraged to be as open as possible so that the
                most accurate information can be used to help formulate your case.<br><br>
                If you have past medical or psychiatric records that may be helpful, copies of laboratory results

                information of your previous psychiatrists or other physicians taking care of you.

                The frequency of appointments is determined through conversations with you and Julia
                Ronconi but could be as often as every one to two weeks or as long as 90 days and depends on
                the type of medication you are prescribed, your medical condition, and the stability and
                complexity of your symptoms. Often, patients are seen more frequently in the beginning stages
                of treatment. Once stability is reached, the frequency of visits lessens.<br><br>
                Patients who have not been seen for over 6 months will become inactive and are not eligible
                for medication refills.

                No. The purpose of a psychiatric evaluation is to closely look at all the factors that may be
                contributing to the difficulty you are experiencing. Once the biological, social, and psychological
                factors involved and how they are interacting is determined, treatment recommendations will
                be discussed. Treatment plans including medication may or may not be recommended and you
                will be actively involved in decisions regarding medications.

            <p class="the-answer" id="answer13">
                Yes. Reducing your psychiatric medications is called “psychiatric deprescribing.” A careful
                review of your psychiatric history is needed to determine if this is appropriate. Psychiatric
                deprescribing is best done slowly and with careful supervision. Julia Ronconi is experienced in
                deprescribing and can work with you to determine if it is appropriate and to develop a
                personalized treatment plan.
